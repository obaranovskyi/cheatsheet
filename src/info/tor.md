Also known as the onion router, takes its name from the way in which it transmits data in layers.
It takes your data, including identifiable information such as your IP address. And it wraps it up in multi-layered 
encryption and sends it through a network of randomly selected relay servers. Each of which only knows 
their small portion of the journey and not the entire entry to exit transfer.

# Downsides
 - Slow internet speeds
 - Restricted access to some websites

 - Not 100% private
