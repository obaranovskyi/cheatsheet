* System-on-chip - (sometimes System-on-a-chip) - chip that integrates all or most components of a computer or other electronic system.
  These components almost always include a central processing unit (CPU), memory interfaces, on-chip input/output devices, input/output interfaces,
  and secondary storage interfaces, often alongside other components such as radio modems and a graphics processing unit (GPU) all on a single substrate or microchip.
* `radio (Wireless/Bluetooth)` - Gives Raspberry Pi the ability to communicate with devices wirelessly.
  The radio itself acts as two main components, in fact: a _WIFI radio_, for connecting to computer
  networks; and a _Bluetooth radio_, for connecting to peripherals like mice and for sending data to
  or receiving data from nearby smart devices like sensors of smartphones.
* `RAM` on raspberry pi - When you're working on Raspberry Pi, it's the RAM that holds what you're doing;
  only when you save your work will it be written to the microSD card. Together, these components from Raspberry Pi's
  volatile and non-volatile memories: the volatile RAM loses its contents whenever Raspberry Pi is powered off, while
  the non-volatile microSD card keeps its contents.
* `I/O` - In computing, input/output or I/O (or, informally, io or IO) is the communication between an information
  processing system, such as a computer, and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing
  system. Inputs are the signals or data received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it.
  The term can also be used as part of an action; to "perform I/O" is to perform an input or output operation.
* `I/O devices` - are the pieces of hardware used by a human (or other system) to communicate with a computer.
  For instance, a keyboard or computer mouse is an input device for a computer, while monitors and printers are output devices.
  Devices for communication between computers, such as modems and network cards, typically perform both input and output operations.
* `Demultiplexer` - A demultiplexer (or demux) is a device that takes a single input line and routes it to one of several digital output lines.
  A demultiplexer of 2n outputs has n select lines, which are used to select which output line to send the input.
  A demultiplexer is also called a data distributor. 
* `Random-access memory (RAM)` - is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used
  to store working data and machine code. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost
  the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.
* `CPU` - A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor or main processor, is the electronic circuitry within a
  computer that executes instructions that make up a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and
  input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least
  since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU),
  distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.
* `clipboard` - is a buffer that some operating systems provide for short-term storage and transfer within and between application programs.
  The clipboard is usually temporary and unnamed, and its contents reside in the computer's RAM. The clipboard is sometimes called the paste buffer.
* `Buffer(or Data buffer)` - is a region of a physical memory storage used to temporarily store data while it is being moved from one place to another.
  Typically, the data is stored in a buffer as it is retrieved from an input device (such as a microphone) or just before it is sent to an output device (such as speakers).
  However, a buffer may be used when moving data between processes within a computer. This is comparable to buffers in telecommunication.
  Buffers can be implemented in a fixed memory location in hardware or by using a virtual data buffer in software, pointing at a location in the physical memory.
  In all cases, the data stored in a data buffer are stored on a physical storage medium. A majority of buffers are implemented in software, which typically use
  the faster RAM to store temporary data, due to the much faster access time compared with hard disk drives. Buffers are typically used when there is a difference
  between the rate at which data is received and the rate at which it can be processed, or in the case that these rates are variable, for example in a printer
  spooler or in online video streaming. In the distributed computing environment, data buffer is often implemented in the form of burst buffer that provides
  distributed buffering service.
* `RAM` - (Random-access memory) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.
  A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same about of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.
* `HDD` - (Hard disk drive) is an electro-mechanical data storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital data using one or more rigid rapidly
  rotation platters coated with magnetic material.
* `Virtual memory` - (also virtual storage) is a memory management technique that provides an "idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually
  available on a given machine" which "creates the illusion to users of a very large (main) memory".
* `Archiving` - is the process of collecting and storing a group of files and directories into one file. The tar utility performs this action.
* `Compression` - is the act of shrinking the size of a file, which is quite useful in sending large files over the internet.
* `POSIX` - The Portable operating system interface (POSIX) is an IEEE standard that helps compatibility and portability between operating systems.
  Theoretically, POSIX compliant source code should be seamlessly portable. In the real world, application transition often runs into system specific issues.
